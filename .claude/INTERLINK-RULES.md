# Interlink Rules — Cross-Site and Internal Linking

## Rules — Non-Negotiable

- **No footer links. Ever.** All links must be contextual in body copy.
- Every blog post must declare `internalLinks` and `externalLinks` in frontmatter
- Min 1 internal link per post, max 3
- Min 1 external link per post, max 2
- Never link to the same external site twice on one page
- Never repeat the same anchor text to the same destination across the site

## CRITICAL: Body Links Must Match Frontmatter

Every hyperlink in body copy MUST also be declared in frontmatter. Links without frontmatter declarations are invisible to tracking.

## CRITICAL: Embed Links During Drafting, Not After

Links MUST be woven into articles during initial drafting. Identify targets BEFORE writing. Retrofitting produces awkward placements.

## Before Writing Any Content

1. Read `src/data/link-network.json` for anchor pools, bridge phrases, adjacency map
2. Read `src/data/link-usage.json` for coverage counts and used anchors
3. Pick external target: lowest coverage count with relevant topic match

## Pre-Commit Link Audit

- [ ] Internal link in frontmatter AND body
- [ ] Cross-site link in frontmatter AND body
- [ ] Target is lowest-coverage site with topic relevance
- [ ] Anchor text not already used for that destination
- [ ] Bridge paragraph in conclusion using adjacency map
- [ ] All body hyperlinks have matching frontmatter
- [ ] Link summary at end of draft

## Anchor Text Approval

Suggest 2-3 options, let owner choose. Never commit without approval.
